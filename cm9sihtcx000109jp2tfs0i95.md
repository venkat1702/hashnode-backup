If you're learning HTML or building websites, you've probably come across the terms semantic and non-semantic HTML. At first, it might sound confusing â€” but donâ€™t worry, it's actually pretty simple.

Letâ€™s understand what these are, how theyâ€™re different, and why semantic HTML is considered a best practice in web development.

### **What is Semantic HTML?**

Semantic HTML means using HTML elements that **clearly describe their meaning** in a way that both the browser and humans can understand.

For example:

* `<header>` tells us this is the top section of a page.
    
* `<nav>` means it's for navigation links.
    
* `<article>` is for an independent piece of content.
    
* `<footer>` is for the bottom section.
    

[other semantic tags](https://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

These tags give **meaning** to your content. Even if someone is just looking at the code, theyâ€™ll understand what each part is doing â€” without guessing.

### What is Non-Semantic HTML?

Non-semantic HTML, on the other hand, uses elements that **donâ€™t tell you anything about the content**.

Example:

* `<div>`
    
* `<span>`
    

These are generic containers. They donâ€™t say *what* the content is â€” just that something is there. You have to use class names or IDs to explain the purpose (like `<div class="header">`), which isnâ€™t as clear.

### Comparison of Non-Semantic vs Semantic HTML

Letâ€™s see a example Below are two versions of a simple web page: one using **non-semantic HTML**, and the other using **semantic HTML**. Both display the same layout â€” a header, navigation menu, main content, and a footer.

### Lighthouse Comparison

When we compare **Non-Semantic HTML** with **Semantic HTML** using Lighthouse, the impact is clearly visibleâ€”especially in **Accessibility** and **SEO** scores.

By simply replacing generic `<div>` tags with meaningful semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`, we saw noticeable improvements:

* **Accessibility Score** improved from **89 â†’ 100**(â†‘ 12.36%)  
    This means the page became fully accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies. Semantic tags help define clear landmarks and structure, making navigation easier for all users.
    
* **SEO Score** increased from **82 â†’ 91**(â†‘ 10.98%)  
    Search engines now understand the page structure better, which helps with proper indexing and ranking.

### Which one should be used when?

**Semantic**

You should use semantic HTML whenever possible. It improves code readability, accessibility, and SEO â€” all without extra effort. If there's a semantic tag that fits your use case, use it â€” it helps both humans and machines understand your page better.

**Non-Semantic**

Sometimes, you do need `<div>` or `<span>`, especially when youâ€™re styling small sections or wrapping things. Theyâ€™re useful â€” just donâ€™t overuse them. Try to go semantic wherever possible.

### In short: Key Differences

| **Feature** | **Semantic HTML** | **Non-Semantic HTML** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meaning in tag? | Yes | No |
| Easier to read? | Yes | No |
| Helps with SEO? | Yes | Not really |
| Good for accessibility? | Yes | Needs extra effort |
